# ü©∫ Onyx Data Challenge - Healthcare Analysis (Power BI Dashboard)

This Power BI project focuses on analyzing **55,500+ unique patient records** from **10 major U.S. hospitals**, with the goal of deriving **actionable insights** for better healthcare decisions, cost optimization, and improved patient outcomes.

## üìå Project Objective

Acting as a Data Analyst for a national healthcare oversight organization, I was tasked with exploring a rich dataset of hospital admissions, medical conditions, medications, billing amounts, and insurance coverage to answer the following key questions:

- What are the most common age groups, genders, and blood types among patients?
- Which medical conditions are diagnosed the most?
- How does the length of hospital stay vary by condition, hospital, or admission type?
- What are the treatment cost patterns by condition, hospital, and insurance provider?
- How do hospitals compare in terms of patient volume and test results?
- What medications are used for each condition and are they consistent across hospitals?
- How does the type of admission (emergency, urgent, planned) impact length of stay and cost?
- Which insurance providers cover the most patients and how does that relate to patient outcomes?
- Are there any regional trends in hospital performance, treatment quality, or costs?
